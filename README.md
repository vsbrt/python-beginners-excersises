46 Simple Python Exercises constructed (but in many cases only found and collected) by Torbj√∂rn Lager (torbjorn.lager@ling.gu.se). Most of them involve characters, words and phrases, rather than numbers, and are therefore suitable for students interested in language rather than math.

list of programs:

1.Define a function max() that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Use the if-then-else construct available in Python. (It is true that Python has the max() function built in, but writing it yourself is nevertheless a good exercise.)

2.Define a function max_of_three() that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.

3.Define a function that computes the length of a given list or string. (It is true that Python has the len() function built in, but writing it yourself is nevertheless a good exercise.)

4.Write a function that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns True if it is a vowel, False otherwise.
